# Credit-Risk-Model
We are given a massive dataset about clients and we want to predict which clients are more likely to default on their loans. So the goal is to use the features in order to predict the target value 1 (will default the loan) or 0 (will not default the loan). The accurcacy is measured using ROC AUC score which tells you how good the classifier is able to separate the 0s and 1s. We used LightGBM to make predictions and got an accuracy of 0.75. 
The data is given in the folder csv_files with train and test folders separately.
